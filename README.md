* 👋 Ahoy there mateys! I'm @shepherd-06, your friendly neighborhood code pirate!
* 👀 I'm always on the lookout for adventure, but when I'm not swashbuckling, I love diving into Front End Web Programming. Yarrr!
* 🌱 I'm currently navigating the treacherous waters of Information Security, and learning how to make my React projects seaworthy!
* 💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on any projects that are as fun and interesting as a buried treasure!
* 📫 You can send a message in a bottle to asif.ibtehaz@tuni.fi, or just fire a cannon shot my way!
* ⚙️ When I'm not tinkering with code, I like to surf the command line like a pro, and I've been known to battle Java beasts and Python pythons in my free time! And don't even get me started on my love for Insomnia - I'd walk the plank for that app!
